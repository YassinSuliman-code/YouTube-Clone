# YouTube Homepage Clone

## Description:
A front-end clone of the YouTube homepage built using **HTML and CSS**.
The goal of this project was to closely replicate the layout, structure,
and interaction patterns of the real YouTube UI while focusing on clean,
maintainable CSS.

## Features:
- Fixed header with search bar, icons, and tooltips
- Collapsible-style sidebar layout
- Responsive video grid using CSS Grid
- Hover effects and interactive UI elements
- Channel preview tooltips on hover
- Pixel-accurate spacing and typography inspired by YouTube

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Media Queries
- Google Fonts (Roboto)

## Responsive Design:
The layout adapts across screen sizes:
- 4 columns on large screens
- 3 columns on medium screens
- 2 columns on smaller screens

Implemented using media queries and flexible grid layouts.

## What I Learned:
- Structuring large layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid together
- Building responsive designs without JavaScript
- Managing fixed-position elements (header and sidebar)
- Creating reusable CSS classes and hover-based interactions
- Paying attention to UI details and spacing for real-world interfaces
